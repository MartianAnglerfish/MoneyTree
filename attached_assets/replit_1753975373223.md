## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Router via Wouter)
- UI library (Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui components)
- Styling (Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority, clsx)
- State management (TanStack React Query)
- Form handling (React Hook Form, Hookform Resolvers)
- Animations (Embla Carousel for carousels)
- Date handling (date-fns)

### Backend Dependencies
- Express.js for server framework
- Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit for database operations
- Neon serverless for PostgreSQL connection
- Session management (express-session, connect-pg-simple)
- Validation (Zod, drizzle-zod)

### Development Dependencies
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESBuild for production builds
- tsx for TypeScript execution in development

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment with:
- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend in development mode
- **Build**: `npm run build` creates optimized production builds for both client and server
- **Production**: `npm start` runs the production server
- **Database**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes to the database

The build process uses Vite for the frontend (outputting to `dist/public`) and ESBuild for the backend (outputting to `dist`), allowing for efficient deployment to platforms like Replit, Vercel, or traditional hosting services.
